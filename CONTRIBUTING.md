# Contributing

## Rules (Humans and AI)
- No work without a confirmed decision lock (`ai/decision-lock.yaml`).
- No code without an approved plan (`ai/plan.md`).
- Changes are milestone-by-milestone.
- Review (`ai/review.md`) and ratify (`ai/ratify.yaml`) are required to merge.

## Workflow
1. Judge confirms stack choices in `ai/decision-lock.yaml`.
2. Planner writes `ai/plan.md`.
3. Builder implements Milestone 1 only.
4. Reviewer writes `ai/review.md`.
5. Ratifier updates `ai/ratify.yaml`.

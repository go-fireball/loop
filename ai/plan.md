# Execution Plan

plan_id: ITER-0001

## Scope Summary
- Describe the smallest valuable deliverable for this iteration.
- Keep scope limited to 80/20 value.

## Simplification Plan
- What can be simplified now to move faster with lower risk?

## Milestones (2-5 max)

### Milestone 1
- Goal:
- Files to change:
- Schema changes:
- Tests to add:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Complexity budget reminder: "Choose the simplest path that delivers the milestone outcome."

### Milestone 2
- Goal:
- Files to change:
- Schema changes:
- Tests to add:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Complexity budget reminder: "No infra expansion unless explicitly approved."

## Risks / Tradeoffs
- Risk:
  - Mitigation:

## Invariant Mapping
- Invariant: [from ai/judgment.yaml]
  - Evidence/plan to satisfy:

## Deferred Complexity
- List intentionally postponed features/architecture.

## Exit Criteria for Scaling Up
- Conditions that justify moving beyond current mode/infra level.

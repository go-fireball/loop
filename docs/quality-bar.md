# Quality Bar

## Single judgment loop
All work must follow the active judgment in `ai/judgment.yaml`. This file sets the operating mode and invariants.

## Mode strictness
- PoC: relaxed testing, minimal documentation, faster iteration.
- MVP: balanced rigor, mandatory decision lock, milestone planning, and review/ratify gates.
- Enterprise: strict invariants, comprehensive tests, and expanded documentation.

## Enforcement
- No planning without a confirmed decision lock.
- No build without an approved plan.
- Review + ratify are required to merge.
